# FLUIDIS

**FLUIDIS** is a work-in-progress fluid simulation software with 3D rendering capabilities, built from scratch.

The long-term goal of FLUIDIS is to provide a high-performance, physically accurate fluid simulation environment — with real-time or near real-time 3D visualization. Whether you're a graphics enthusiast, a simulation researcher, or just curious, FLUIDIS aims to be a learning-friendly yet powerful tool.
